Hello. I’m interested in stories and the narratives that drive our view of the way the world is, the way the world ought to be and our role in changing it.

I’ve developed campaigns for the past two decades that seek progress through compelling stories and meaningful action. I collaborate with some brilliant and creative people to turn ideas into campaigns, and campaigns into movements for change. Sometimes we [win](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2015/11/06/malala-a-full-secondary-education-must-become-the-ordinary-expectation-of-every-girl-in-the-world), but certainly not always.

I write. Often for and with other people. You’ve probably read something I’ve written or even heard it spoken by a pretty badass individual.

Here I’m mainly writing about people on the margins of history and society as well as ‘misinformation’ and narratives.

Send me a message at jasonw(at)hey.com and say, “Hello, Wojo.”
